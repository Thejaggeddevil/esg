tone at the top and middle
running a business in accordance with our stated 
ethics and company values starts with our board and 
management setting a cultural “tone at the top"
cognizant-current-sustainability-report,Governance,ethics,"this begins with the executive 
leadership team sharing required ethics and 
compliance messaging with their respective teams"
cognizant-current-sustainability-report,Governance,ethics,"we believe that 
making the principles of our code of ethics more 
accessible to our associates has helped maintain high 
standards of legal compliance and assisted in 
improving workplace culture and outcomes"
cognizant-current-sustainability-report,Governance,ethics,"to demonstrate tone at the top:
• our chief executive officer, chief ethics and 
compliance officer and chief people officer held a 
fireside chat entitled “ethics in action: doing the 
right thing"
cognizant-current-sustainability-report,Governance,ethics,"” they emphasized the expectation that 
both leaders and associates should model ethical 
behavior and lead by example to build trust and 
consistency in relationships with stakeholders, clients 
and employees
• ethics & compliance was featured at our growth 
summit with a presentation by our chief legal 
officer, chief administrative officer, and corporate 
secretary on “doing the right thing, the right way”
as part of our tone at the middle 
program, we:
• introduced an ethics & compliance toolkit for 
leaders to provide them with practical ways to talk 
to their teams about integrity, compliance, ethical 
dilemmas and good decision-making
• continued to build our ambassador program, 
training associates across the company to promote 
an ethical culture and raise awareness about ethics 
• coordinated ethics & compliance awareness week, 
which featured a panel discussion on ethical 
decision-making and leadership and provided 
information on important resources
• expanded the leadership section of the code of 
ethics training to include additional leaders to 
provide broader guidance and reinforce 
ethical standards
• organized interactive ethical workshops during
